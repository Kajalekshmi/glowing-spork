    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        There’s nothing cookie-cutter about Pizza Hut. Not our pizzas. 
        <br >Not our people. And definitely not the way we live life. 
        <br >Around here, we don’t settle for anything less than food we’re proud to serve. 
        <br >And we don’t just clock in. 
       <br >Not when we can also become our best, make friends, and have fun while we’re at it.</p>
